# Deployment Instructions for Render.com

## Environment Variables Configuration

Configure the following environment variables in the Render.com dashboard:

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your web service
3. Click on the "Environment" tab
4. Add the following environment variables:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Sets the application to production mode |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | `[generate a random string]` | Secret for session encryption. Use a long random string. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `[your database connection string]` | Already configured in your Render.com service |

> **Important**: For `SESSION_SECRET`, use a secure random string. You can generate one with this command:
> ```
> node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
> ```

## Build and Start Commands

Ensure your Render.com service is configured with the following commands:

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`

Альтернативная команда запуска (если вы получаете ошибку Drizzle):
```
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

## Troubleshooting Database Errors

### Common Database Connection Errors

If you see an error like this during deployment:

```
error: cannot drop view pg_stat_statements_info because extension pg_stat_statements requires it
```

This is related to the Drizzle ORM migration process and can be safely ignored. The application should still function correctly as long as your database schema is properly set up.

### Neon PostgreSQL WebSocket Connection Issues

If you encounter WebSocket connection errors with Neon PostgreSQL, check the following:

1. Verify that your DATABASE_URL environment variable is correctly formatted
2. Make sure that the Neon PostgreSQL project allows connections from your Render instance's IP range
3. Check that your database has the necessary extensions enabled

We've improved the database connection reliability with the following enhancements:

1. Added additional error handling for connection issues
2. Implemented proper WebSocket configuration for Neon PostgreSQL
3. Enhanced SSL/TLS settings for secure database connections
4. Added detailed error logging for better troubleshooting

## Note About Authentication

The authentication system in this application has been configured to work correctly in both development and production environments. The changes include:

1. Proper session cookie configuration for secure environments
2. HTTPS-compatible cookie settings
3. Cross-domain support for authentication
4. Improved handling of authentication state in the frontend
5. Enhanced error handling during login/registration processes
6. Better client-side error messages for authentication issues

If you encounter any authentication issues after deployment, verify that:
- The `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable is set
- `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`
- Your database connection is working properly

### Debugging Authentication Problems

If users cannot log in or register, check the following:

1. Examine server logs for detailed error messages about database connection issues
2. Verify that session cookies are being correctly set (check browser developer tools)
3. Make sure the Render.com service has the correct environment variables
4. Check that the database tables for users and sessions have been properly created

## Client-Side Error Handling Improvements

We've enhanced error handling throughout the application to:

1. Display more helpful error messages to users
2. Better handle network connection issues
3. Provide detailed error information during form validation
4. Add robust error recovery for most common failure scenarios

## Database Connection Monitoring 

The application now includes basic database connection monitoring:

1. Connection status is logged during server startup
2. Connection errors are captured with detailed information
3. Automatic retry capability for temporary connection issues
4. Better user feedback for database-related errors
